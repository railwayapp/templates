# certificate can be generated by running the following

#
#     mix phx.gen.cert

# Note that this task requires Erlang/OTP 20 or later.
# Run `mix help phx.gen.cert` for more information.

#       certfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned.pem"
#     ],
#
# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.
