### Installing
To install all the dependencies, run `yarn install` in the terminal. This should install all required dependencies for building and
development of your vite app.

### Building
To build the app, run `yarn build`. This should create a dist directory. Building is also done when you push to railway so that your app can be hosted as a static web page.

## Development
Use the vite development server whilst developing on your local machine. To do this, you only need to run `yarn dev` and the project will be set up.

*Many thanks towards the helpful team at railway who helped me find issues during configuration.*
